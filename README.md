# GitHub Action - CI/CD Pipeline

This repository contains a GitHub Action workflow designed to automate the CI/CD pipeline for your project. The workflow ensures that your code is built, tested, and deployed efficiently.

## Features

- **Continuous Integration (CI):**

  - Automatically builds and tests your code on every push or pull request.
  - Ensures code quality and prevents breaking changes.

- **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
  - Deploys your application to the specified environment (e.g., staging, production) after successful tests.
  - Supports multiple deployment strategies (e.g., rolling updates, blue-green deployments).

## Workflow Overview

The GitHub Action workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` file. Below is an overview of the key steps:

1. **Trigger Events:**

- Runs on `push` to the main branch.
- Runs on `pull_request` events.

2. **Build:**

- Installs dependencies.
- Builds the application.

3. **Test:**

- Runs unit tests and integration tests.
- Generates test reports.

4. **Deploy:**

- Deploys the application to the target environment.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the repository:

```bash
cd <repository-name>
```

3. Update the .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml file to match your project requirements (e.g., build commands, test scripts, deployment steps).

4. Stage and commit your changes, then push to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Set up CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
```
